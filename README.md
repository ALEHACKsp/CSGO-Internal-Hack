<h1>CSGO-Internal-Hack</h1>
<h3>An example of Internal Game Hacking (CSGO) using CTHackFramework.</h3>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        &emsp;An example of internal game hacking based on CTHackFramework, give you a basic idea of game hacking using C/C++ and CTHackFramework.   
    </p>
    <p>
        &emsp;Since it`s a so-called "Internal" hack, what does it means is that basically, instead of creating a new process and then read/write data in the memory of the game process, "internal" hack would inject our codes into the target process, and run our code inside target proc, which has lots of advantages compared with External method.
        <ul>
            <li>Faster memory access</li>
            <p>&emsp;Within the process, you can access memory directly and freely cause target memory is also "your" memory, if you get the idea. </p>
            <li>The same privilege</li>
            <p>&emsp;Since target process consider your code as his code, your code will run with the same privilege as the targer process does.</p>
            <li>Concealment</li>
            <p>&emsp;If done right, the hack code will not be detected by anti-cheat system that easy.</p>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        &emsp;First, we use DLL injection to inject our .dll into the target process, then we hook the d3d9 device of the target process, so we can replace present()
        function with our modified one, draw our contents after the game has finished drawing and before it present to the user. Here we use ImGui for gui. Then we
        can do stuff as we want, change the value, read enemy position, fire your weapon, etc.
    </p>

<h2>Feature</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Trigger Bot</b></li>
        <p>
            &emsp;When your crosshair is pointing to an enemy, the trigger is pulled automatically by trigger bot. You can also add auto recoil
            compensation, scope-only mode, etc. Automatically change the behavior based on what weapon you are holding.
        </p>
        <li><b>Aim Bot</b></li>
        <img src="https://github.com/CelestialTS/CSGO-Internal-Hack/blob/master/Image/Aimbot.png" alt="AimBot" width=1600 height="=900">
        <p>
            &emsp;In Aimlock mode, your crosshair is locked to the nearest enemy`head. You can lock enemy whether it`s behind the wall or not, but you can also lock
            on an enemy only if he is visible in your screen of view.
        </p> 
        <p>
            &emsp;In FOV(Field of View) mode, your crosshair will snap to the nearest enemy that is within specific angle range, for example only when enemy whose head
            is nearby your crosshair with a range about 10 degrees. To be more advanced, you can use dynamic FOV range, different horizontal and vertical sensitivity, 
            movement speed compensation, etc.
        </p> 
        <li><b>Glow Wall Hack</b></li>  
        <p>
            &emsp;Glow hack will glow all the entity we interested in, such as enemies, weapons on the ground, C4, grenades,etc. You can also use the color picker provided
            by ImGui to customize the color for different entities.
        </p>  
        <img src="https://github.com/CelestialTS/CSGO-Internal-Hack/blob/master/Image/glow.png" alt="Glow" width=1600 height="=900">
        <li><b>Radar Hack</b></li>
        <p>
            &emsp;Radar hack will display the marker which stands for an enemy on your in-game radar when the enemy is nearby, even if they've never shown their self.
        </p>

        <li><b>Bhop</b></li>
        <p>
            &emsp;Good old bhop, jump like a bunny, gain speed and move your ass faster than what your component could imagine.
        </p>  
        <li><b>SkinChanger</b></li>
        <p>
            &emsp;Access all the skins available in CSGO, dragon lore, fire serpent,etc. Change the skin as you wish, without limitation. You can change the worn and the seed of
            the skin and all the add-ons available, such as statrack, nametag. Knives and gloves can also be changed, but in this example, this feature is not implemented.

<h2>Dependency</h2>
<h4>Dear ImGui</h4>
<p>
        &emsp;Dear ImGui is a bloat-free graphical user interface library for C++. It outputs optimized vertex buffers that you can render anytime in your 3D-pipeline enabled application. It is fast,
    portable, renderer agnostic and self-contained (no external dependencies).
</p> 
<p>&emsp;Check Dear ImGui on github: <a href="https://github.com/ocornut/imgui">Dear ImGui</a></p>

<h4>Injector</h4>
<p>
        &emsp;nefarius`s Dll Injector is a command line tool abstracting the messy injection process away from you.

<h4>Indicium-Supra</h4>
<p>
        &emsp;Indicium-Supra consists of a self-contained library (DLL) which exposes a minimalistic API for rendering custom content in foreign processes
    eliminating the need for in-depth knowledge about Direct3D and API-hooking. The most common use-case might be drawing custom overlays on top
    of your games. The framework takes care about pesky tasks like detecting the DirectX version the game was built for and supports
    runtime-hooking (no special launcher application required).
